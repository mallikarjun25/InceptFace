# InceptFace
Project Name: InceptFace – Facial Recognition with InceptionResNetV1

This repository contains the implementation of a facial recognition system using the InceptionResNetV1 architecture and the VGGFace2 dataset. The project focuses on training and evaluating a deep learning model for accurate face classification, leveraging a robust preprocessing pipeline to handle variations in facial expressions, lighting, and environmental conditions. The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer with tuned hyperparameters, and Cross Entropy Loss is used for classification.

🚀 Features:<br>
✔️ InceptionResNetV1-based deep learning model<br>
✔️ Preprocessing pipeline for real-world robustness<br>
✔️ Hyperparameter tuning with learning rate scheduling<br>
✔️ Multi-class face classification using VGGFace2<br>
